# BHDetection_GlobularClusters

Globular clusters are a dense collection of stars that contain thousands to millions of old stars packed within a region only tens of light years across.
Their high stellar densities make it very probable that their member stars will interact or collide. Some theoretical work suggests that dynamical processes 
in the densest inner regions of globular clusters may lead to the formation of black holes of âˆ¼1,000 solar masses.
Given parameters of a Globular Cluster, we aim to predict the number of Single Black Holes, Binary Black Holes and the Mass of the most Massive Black Hole.
